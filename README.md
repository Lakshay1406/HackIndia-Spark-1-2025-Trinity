# SupplierGPT - An Invoice Management Agent 

## Project Description

SupplierGPT is an AI-powered solution designed to streamline invoice dispute resolution for multi-national companies. Often, disputes related to invoices take up to 100 days to resolve, causing delays and negatively impacting relationships between suppliers and customers. The traditional communication method—email—often leads to lost messages and extended resolution times.

With SupplierGPT, we leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance efficiency and transparency in the invoice dispute resolution process. SupplierGPT helps classify disputes and allows customers to track invoice processing in real-time, significantly reducing delays.

### Key Benefits:
- **AI-powered dispute resolution**: Automates and accelerates the process.
- **Real-time tracking**: Monitor the progress of invoice processing.
- **Invoice payment history**: View detailed history and past disputes.
- **Enhanced communication**: Provides clear, efficient communication throughout the process.

By reducing manual labor and inefficiency, SupplierGPT transforms how invoice disputes are handled, making it a valuable solution for today's fast-paced industries.
